# NewtonBench: A Benchmark for Generalizable Scientific Law Discovery in LLM Agents

## Introduction
We introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising 324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. NewtonBench is designed to rigorously evaluate the scientific reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by moving beyond memorization toward true discovery. 

It combines two core innovations: a metaphysical shift, which systematically modifies canonical physical laws to create conceptually grounded yet novel problems, and an interactive, system-oriented environment, where agents must design experiments and interpret feedback within confounded systems. The benchmark provides two independent dimensions of difficulty: the complexity of the target law, and the complexity of the model systems.

By optionally integrating a code execution interface, NewtonBench isolates reasoning from computational constraints, revealing the genuine frontiers of LLMs’ ability to discover scientific laws in complex, interactive settings.

## Get Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm_phys_discovery.git
cd llm_phys_discovery
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Conda Environment

```
conda create --name newtonbench python=3.10.18
conda activate newtonbench
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up API Keys

1.  In the root of the project, make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it `.env`.
2.  Specify the following:
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for using OpenAI models
    - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key for using models provided in OpenRouter


### 5. Run the Quick Start

You are now ready to run a quick test to ensure everything is set up correctly.

```
python quick_start.py
```

The `quick_start.py` script will run two simple experiments using the `gpt41mini` model under "vanilla agent" and "code-assisted agent" modes for "Gravitation" domain, equation difficulty as "easy" and model system as "vanilla equation"

### Key Components

- **Physics Modules**: Each of the 12 physics domains is implemented as a separate module with its own physics simulation, law definitions, and prompts.
- **Agent Types**: Two agent modes are supported:
  - **Vanilla Agent**: LLM reasoning only, no code execution
  - **Code-Assisted Agent**: LLM with Python code execution capabilities
- **Difficulty Levels**: Tasks vary across two dimensions:
  - Difficulty of the target law: easy/medium/hard
  - Complexity of the model systems: vanilla equation/simple system/complex system

## Running Full Experiments

To replicate more comprehensive evaluations as described in the paper, the `run_master.py` script allows you to run the full benchmark across all physics modules and a variety of LLM models.

### Method 1: Using `models.txt`

You can specify a list of LLM models to test by editing the `configs/models.txt` file. The default file includes all 11 LLMs evaluated in our paper

**Example `configs/models.txt`:**

```
# List of models to be evaluated
gpt41
o4mini
gpt5
```
**Remark**: The model names in the `models.txt` file must match exactly with those specified in `utils/call_llm_api.py`.

Once you have configured the `models.txt` file, you can run the benchmark with the following command. The `--parallel` argument specifies how many experiments to run in parallel.

```
python run_master.py --parallel 5
```

### Method 2: Specifying a Single Model

If you want to run the benchmark for a single model, you can use the `--model_name` command-line argument.

```
python run_master.py --model_name gpt41mini --parallel 5
```

### Controlling Parallelism

The `--parallel` argument controls the number of concurrent processes. A higher number will run more experiments and open more terminals at the same time, which can be faster but will also consume more system resources.

```
# Run 8 experiments in parallel
python run_master.py --parallel 8
```

### Analyzing Results

After running experiments, you can use the `result_analysis/summarize_results.py` script to process and aggregate the results into a summary CSV file.

The script performs two main functions in a single run:
1.  **Consolidation**: It finds all individual trial `.json` files in the `evaluation_results` directory and compiles them into a single raw data file: `result_analysis/results_by_trial.csv`.
2.  **Aggregation**: It then processes `results_by_trial.csv`, performs statistical analysis (including outlier detection) and generates a final summary csv file named `aggregated_trial_summary.csv`.

To generate the summary for all models listed in `configs/models.txt`, run:

```
python result_analysis/summarize_results.py
```

You can also generate the summary for a single model by specifying its name. For example:

```
python result_analysis/summarize_results.py --model_name gpt41mini
```
